# Parsing Wikipedia Content

After doing a bit of work to get the fallacies from the list of page, the next task is to also make it work for cognitive biases.

In the past, this was the first wikipedia page that was used, so there should be some code lying around that does just this. Currently, we get this error from the api:

```
error:
