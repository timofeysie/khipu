## Sprint 3 planing

Start: April, 2021.

Getting a head start on planning for the next sprint here.

Goals:

Either of these would be good.

1. export the list
2. order the list

I really wanted to order the list first, but exporting is more helpful to the project in general. Most people would be using this app to generate content for whatever LMS/LRS they are using. If a school uses Canva for it's LMS, and a custom backend LRS, then we should be able to export to those formats. Getting data back via an LRS would impact the order of the list, the app could also be used to substitute for a part of the ecosystem.

Canva and Moodle should all take class material in a tab or comma delineated format.

A full workflow would be:

1. create a category
2. edit the content for inclusion
3. show the list with an order based viewing/testing
4. see statistics for progress

Before all this, probably the next sprint should be finishing off everything not working from the last sprint. Those tasks look like this:

If this can all get sorted, then, yes, exporting might need to be next. It's actually a toss up between creating an order for the list export. Ordering just according to the number of detail views might be doable pretty quickly. But so would search.
