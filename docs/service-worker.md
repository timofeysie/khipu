# Service worker

There are three services shown in the official Angular docs to interact with the service worker.

```
check-for-update.service.ts
log-update.service.ts
prompt-update.service.ts
```

At first they were put in the core module, but maybe this is not the best place for them?  They will only be used on the options page, so maybe a services in the options page would be better.

Since we don't have an options module yet, they can stay in the about module for now.  The options and theming service should be a separate task, and the functionality can be moved there later.  The about page is actually a good idea and should be used for providing information about the app eventually.

Since the NgxRocket boilerplate start this project is based on also touts service worker integration with PWA support, I wonder about that versus what the official Angular docs say about it.  Nowhere in the app boilerplate do we see:
```
ServiceWorkerModule.register
```

Anyhow, the issue #1 is all about this.

## Publish on Firebase

The following are notes from the Tiwanaku project.

create the project in Firebase.
https://console.firebase.google.com/?pli=1

Complete the setup:
```
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase init
ionic build --prod
```


### Making changes to the PWA

1. If using an incognito window, open a second blank tab (This will keep the incognito and the cache state alive).
2. Close the application tab, but not the window. This should also close the Developer Tools.
3. Shut down http-server.
4. Build and run the server again.


### The Check for Update Service

Following [the official demo code](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/aio/content/examples/service-worker-getting-started), created these providers.

```
ng g s services/check-for-update
ng g s services/log-update
ng g s services/prompt-update
```

### The check for update button
```
<button id="check" (click)="updateCheck()">Check for Update</button>
<p id="checkResult">{{updateCheckText}}</p>
```

[This deployment guide](https://itnext.io/build-a-production-ready-pwa-with-angular-and-firebase-8f2a69824fcc) describes a production ready PWA process in decent depth.


### Caching strategies
* performance (resources that donâ€™t change often)
* freshness (resources that change frequently)


### Asset groups
* lazy strategy
* prefetch strategy

10. Configuring a Firebase hosting for your PWA
* configure rewrite as above to point all sources to your index.html file
* the vendorChunk option in angular.json will because you will not update vendor libraries too often.
